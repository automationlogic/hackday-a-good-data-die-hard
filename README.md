# AL Hack Day
This repo contains partial dumps of what our team built for the AL Hack Day challenge.

## Data
We decided to use [Mitre CVE data](https://cve.mitre.org/) to show a change in distribution of vulnerability for different operating systems over years. Our hypothesis was: "Mac OS has the lowest amount of vulnerabilities of major OSs"
